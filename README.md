# CADSysFNC

A 2D/3D vector graphics and CAD library for Delphi, built on **TMS FNC** so that
one set of sources serves VCL and FMX from the same code.

CADSysFNC is a port of Piero Valagussa's **CADSys 4.2**. The geometry, the shape
hierarchy, the display list and the interaction model are his; what changed is
everything underneath them — drawing now goes through a backend rather than
straight onto a `TCanvas`, the persisted format is JSON, colours carry alpha, and
the controls descend from `TTMSFNCCustomControl`. See
[docs/migrating.md](docs/migrating.md) if you are coming from CADSys 4.2.

## What you get

* A **display list** of shapes in floating-point world coordinates — lines, arcs,
  ellipses, curves, splines, polygons, outlines, vector and bitmap text, images,
  containers and reusable source blocks — on 256 layers.
* A **viewport** control that draws it, with zoom, pan, a grid, snapping and
  hit-testing, plus horizontal and vertical rulers.
* An **interaction engine** (`TFNCCADPrg`) built from small state classes:
  select, move, rotate, edit control points, draw each primitive. Writing a new
  tool means writing a state, not touching the viewport.
* **Printing**, with a page model that knows about paper: standard sizes,
  margins, fit-to-page or a stated scale, and multi-page tiling. A preview
  control draws through the same code the printer does, so the two cannot
  drift. Line weights can be given in millimetres, which is what makes a print
  look like a drawing rather than a fax.
* **Import/export**: JSON (the native format), DXF in and out, the legacy binary
  `.CS2` format for reading old drawings, and — on VCL — printing and clipboard.
* Everything is source. New shapes and new operations are the intended way to use
  it, not a last resort.

## Status

| Framework | State |
|---|---|
| **VCL** | Complete. Test suites green, demo verified across a 240 DPI and a 96 DPI display. |
| **FMX** | Complete. Drawing, zoom, grid, rulers, snap, selection, editing, DXF, saved views — all verified by hand on Windows at both display scales. |
| **Lazarus / LCL** | Sources carry the LCL branches, but nothing has been built. Blocked on TMS FNC Core for FPC. |

Only Windows has been exercised. Nothing in the library is Windows-specific any
more except `VCL.FNCCS4GraphicsVCL` and `VCL.FNCCS4ExportVCL`, which are VCL-only
by design — but "should compile" is not "has run", and no other platform has been
tried.

## Requirements

* **Delphi 12** (BDS 23.0). Earlier versions are untested; nothing knowingly
  depends on a 12-only feature.
* **TMS FNC Core 4.4** or later, installed for the frameworks you intend to use.
* Windows, for now.

## Installing

```
git clone https://github.com/OwlHatSoftware/CADSysFNC
cd CADSysFNC
Tools\gen-units.cmd
```

**That second step is not optional.** `Sources` holds one master copy of each
unit, named `VCL.*`; the generator writes the per-framework copies into
`Generated\VCL`, `Generated\FMX` and `Generated\LCL`, which is what everything
compiles against. `Generated\` is not in the repository, so a fresh clone
compiles nothing until you have run it once — and again after you edit anything
in `Sources`.

Then build the packages in `Packages\delphi`, **runtime first**:

| Order | Package | |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `FNCCadSysVCL` | runtime, VCL — build, do not install |
| 2 | `FNCCadSysFMX` | runtime, FMX — build, do not install |
| 3 | `FNCCadSysDEVCL` | design-time, VCL palette — build and **install** |
| 4 | `FNCCadSysDEFMX` | design-time, FMX palette — build and **install** |

The design-time packages only register what the runtime packages contain, so
installing one built against a stale runtime BPL fails in ways that do not name
the cause. Build 1 and 2 before 3 and 4, every time.

Add `<repo>\Generated\VCL` (or `\FMX`) to the library path of any project that
uses the units directly.

> **About the unit names.** `VCL.FNCCADSys4`, `VCL.FNCCS4Shapes`, and so on:
> `FNCC` is the stem every unit shares so the generator can turn one tree into
> three with a single substitution, and the `VCL.` / `FMX.` / `LCL` prefix is
> which tree you are looking at. Unlovely, and load-bearing.

Both palettes can be installed at once, and both appear on a palette page called
**FNCCadSys**: `TFNCCADCmp2D`, `TFNCCADViewport2D` and `TFNCCADPrg2D`.

`Tools\build-packages.cmd [BDSVER]` builds all four from the command line into
`Tools\build\pkg` without touching what the IDE has installed — useful for
checking a change compiles, not a substitute for installing.

## A minimal program

Three components. The *document* holds the shapes, the *viewport* draws it, the
*program* turns mouse and keyboard into operations on it.

```pascal
uses
  VCL.FNCCADSys4, VCL.FNCCS4Shapes, VCL.FNCCS4Tasks,
  VCL.FNCCadSysRegister;   // its initialization fills the class registry

procedure TForm1.FormCreate(Sender: TObject);
begin
  fCAD := TFNCCADCmp2D.Create(Self);

  fView := TFNCCADViewport2D.Create(Self);
  fView.Parent := Self;
  fView.Align := alClient;
  fView.CADCmp := fCAD;
  fView.GridDeltaX := 10.0;
  fView.GridDeltaY := 10.0;

  fPrg := TFNCCADPrg2D.Create(Self);
  fPrg.Viewport2D := fView;

  // world coordinates, not pixels
  fCAD.AddObject(-1, TLine2D.Create(-1, Point2D(0, 0), Point2D(100, 50)));
  fCAD.AddObject(-1, TEllipse2D.Create(-1, Point2D(0, 0), Point2D(60, 60)));
  fView.ZoomToExtension;

  // let the user draw another line: a state class, plus a parameter
  // object carrying the shape it should build
  fPrg.StartOperation(TCAD2DDrawSizedPrimitive,
    TCAD2DDrawSizedPrimitiveParam.Create(nil,
      TLine2D.Create(-1, Point2D(0, 0), Point2D(0, 0)), 0, True));
end;
```

`VCL.FNCCadSysRegister` must be in the uses clause of every application, not only
in the packages: its `initialization` is what fills the class registry, and
without it `LoadFromFile` has no class to map a stored shape onto.

On FMX the same code reads `FMX.FNCCADSys4`, `TAlignLayout.Client`, and so on —
the API is identical.

## Demos

| | |
|---|---|
| `Demos\CAD2D\VCL` | The full demo: drawing, editing, layers, DXF, saved views, printing. |
| `Demos\CAD2D\FMX` | **The same program**, written for FMX. Diff the two `MainFrm.pas` — around 300 lines of 1,030 differ, and all of it is framework spelling. |
| `Demos\CADCmpDemo\VCL` | The document without a viewport. |
| `Demos\PointsVectDemo\VCL` | The point and vector primitives on their own. |

Each CAD2D demo writes an unbuffered step log beside its executable, which is
there to survive a hard crash rather than to be pretty.

## Tests

Two DUnitX console suites under `Test`, run together by
`Tools\build-and-test.cmd [BDSVER]`:

* `CADSys4Tests` — geometry, structures, shapes, JSON persistence, DXF, the
  drawing layer and the VCL backend. 518 tests.
* `CADSysFNCTests` — the FNC backend drawn into a `TTMSFNCGraphics` bitmap. Kept
  separate so the main suite does not need FNC to run.

`Tools\build-vcl.cmd` and `Tools\build-fmx.cmd` build the two demos; the FMX one
also compiles `Test\CADSysFMXCheck.dpr`, which links every unit and runs nothing.
All four scripts regenerate the per-framework units first and write to
`Tools\logs\`. Run all four before believing a change that touches shared code.

## Repository layout

```
Sources\        the master units (VCL.*) and the framework include files
Generated\      per-framework copies - build output, not in the repository
Packages\       delphi\ (four packages) and Lazarus\ (unbuilt)
Demos\          four demo programs; CAD2D exists twice, once per framework
Test\           the two DUnitX suites
Tools\          the generator and the build scripts
docs\           format reference, migration guide, and the port history
Documentations\ the original CADSys 4.2 help file and change log
```

## Known limitations

* The palette icons in `Packages\delphi\FNCCadSys.dcr` are still keyed to the old
  class names, so the components show the default icon until the resource is
  rebuilt.
* An opaque hatch pattern no longer fills the gaps between its lines.
* `CopingFrequency` no longer shows partial results during a long repaint.
* The print **preview** works on VCL and FMX; the **printer** path is VCL-only,
  because it wants a `TPrinter` and a GDI device context. The page model
  underneath is framework-free, so an FMX printer is a unit to write rather than
  a design to redo. There is no PDF output yet.
* Everything the library measures other than a line weight is still in pixels —
  the pick aperture, control-point handles, ruler ticks. Only pen weight and
  hatch spacing have a physical size.
* No drawing made by the original library is in the repository - the `.CS2`
  fixtures in `Test\data` were synthesised from the format description, not
  written by a pre-port CADSys.

## Documentation

* [docs/migrating.md](docs/migrating.md) — what changed from CADSys 4.2, and what
  existing code has to change.
* [docs/json-format.md](docs/json-format.md) — the persisted document format.
* [docs/port/](docs/port/) — the port history and the pre-port code review. These
  are a record of how the library got here, not a user guide, and they are kept
  because several of the traps in them are still traps.
* `Documentations\CADSYS42.HLP` — Piero Valagussa's original help file. The class
  and method documentation in it is still accurate wherever this port did not
  change the signature.
