rem ---------------------------------------------------------------------
rem Builds the VCL demo. Nothing is run; the point is the compiler's
rem opinion and an exe to click.
rem
rem   build-vcl.cmd [BDSVER]           BDSVER defaults to 23.0 (Delphi 12)
rem
rem This is the counterpart of build-fmx.cmd. Read the two side by side:
rem the differences between them are the differences between the
rem frameworks, and nothing else.
rem
rem   Demos\CAD2D\VCL          - the same project the IDE opens.
rem                              Compiling is not the same as working.

rem Log: Tools\logs\build-vcl.log
rem
rem There is no VCL equivalent of Test\CADSysFMXCheck.dpr here, and
rem there does not need to be: build-and-test.cmd compiles the whole
rem library with CADSYS_VCL on its way to running the suites. The FMX
rem side needs a link-everything project precisely because it has no
rem suite to run.
rem
rem The dcus go to the same folder build-and-test.cmd uses, which is
rem safe here and would not be on the FMX side: same defines, same
rem namespaces, same library. The FMX build keeps its own folder
rem because mixing dcus built with different defines gives stale or
rem wrong-framework symbols and errors that make no sense.

rem --- the generated unit copies --------------------------------------

rem a file nobody edited.

rem Demos\common is on the unit path because dcc32 resolves a dpr's
rem "unit in 'path'" clause against the CURRENT directory, not against
rem the dpr's own folder, and only then falls back to -U. This script
rem compiles from Tools\build\vcl, so DemoLog's '..\..\common' misses
rem and has to be found here instead.

rem --- a stray project .cfg would win ----------------------------------
rem dcc32 reads a config named after the project it is compiling, from
rem that project's own folder, as well as the dcc32.cfg in the current
rem directory - and the project one wins. Four of these were inherited
rem from the original author's Delphi 5 install, carrying
rem -LE"c:\programmi\borland\delphi5\Projects\Bpl", a -U pointing at a
rem source folder on his machine and -$D- against our -$D+. They are
rem deleted; this refuses to compile if one ever comes back, because
rem the alternative is a build configured by a file nobody read.
