rem ---------------------------------------------------------------------
rem Compiles the library with CADSYS_FMX defined. Nothing is run; the
rem point is the compiler's opinion.
rem
rem   build-fmx.cmd [BDSVER]           BDSVER defaults to 23.0 (Delphi 12)
rem
rem Two things get built:
rem
rem   Test\CADSysFMXCheck.dpr   - links every unit, runs nothing. The
rem                               compile-only error loop.
rem   Demos\CAD2D\FMX          - the FMX port of the CAD2D demo, the
rem                               same project the IDE opens. Compiling
rem                               is not the same as working.
rem
rem Log: Tools\logs\build-fmx.log
rem
rem Two deliberate differences from build-and-test.cmd:
rem
rem   -NS has the FMX namespaces and NOT the Vcl ones. A bare 'Graphics'
rem   or 'Controls' left in a shared uses clause would otherwise resolve
rem   to the VCL unit and compile happily here while failing in a real
rem   FMX project.
rem
rem   The dcus go to their own folder. Same unit names, different
rem   defines - mixing them with the VCL build's dcus gives stale or
rem   wrong-framework symbols and errors that make no sense.

rem "unit in 'path'" clause against the CURRENT directory, not against
rem the dpr's own folder, and only then falls back to -U. This script
rem compiles from Tools\build\fmx, so every such path in a demo dpr
rem misses and has to be found here instead.

rem --- a stray project .cfg would win ----------------------------------
rem dcc32 reads a config named after the project it is compiling, from
rem that project's own folder, as well as the dcc32.cfg in the current
rem directory - and the project one wins. Four of these were inherited
rem from the original author's Delphi 5 install, carrying
rem -LE"c:\programmi\borland\delphi5\Projects\Bpl", a -U pointing at a
rem source folder on his machine and -$D- against our -$D+. They are
rem deleted; this refuses to compile if one ever comes back, because
rem the alternative is a build configured by a file nobody read.
