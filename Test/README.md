# CADSysFNC — DUnitX test suites

Two console DUnitX suites for the library units, built for **Delphi 12** with the
DUnitX that ships with the IDE (`$(BDS)\source\DUnitX`).

| Project | Covers | Last run |
|---|---|---|
| `CADSys4Tests` | the library: geometry, structures, shapes, JSON, DXF, the legacy reader, saved views, the drawing layer and its VCL backend | 518 found, 510 passed, 0 failed, 8 ignored |
| `CADSysFNCTests` | the FNC backend, drawn into a `TTMSFNCGraphics` bitmap | 20 / 20 |

They are separate projects so the main suite does not need TMS FNC to run.

## Running them

```
Tools\build-and-test.cmd [BDSVER]      default BDSVER is 23.0 (Delphi 12)
```

That regenerates the per-framework units, builds both runners and runs both,
writing `build.log`, `test.log`, `results.xml`, `build-fnc.log`, `test-fnc.log`
and `results-fnc.xml` into `Tools\logs\`.

To run one by hand:

```
CADSys4Tests.exe                              full run, console output
CADSys4Tests.exe --exitbehavior:Continue      for CI - no "press Enter" pause
CADSys4Tests.exe --xmloutput:results.xml      NUnit XML
```

The exit code is non-zero if anything failed.

**The projects compile against `..\Generated\VCL`, not `..\Sources`.** `Sources`
holds the master copy of each unit; `Tools\gen-units.cmd` writes the
per-framework trees, and that is what everything builds from. The build script
runs the generator first, so a hand-run of `msbuild` against a stale `Generated`
is the one way to test yesterday's code by accident.

`msbuild` is avoided in the script for an unrelated reason: it hands the compiler
the IDE's entire Win32 library search path on the command line, which with enough
TMS products installed exceeds Windows' 32000-character limit and dies with
MSB6003 before reading a line of Pascal. The script calls `dcc32` directly.

The Debug configuration does **not** turn on range or overflow checking. The
library's convention is range-checks-off, and three units now declare
`{$RANGECHECKS OFF}` themselves because `PVectPoints2D` is the
variable-length-array idiom. Turning them on project-wide is still worth doing
deliberately — it is how the `Word` capacity truncation and the draw-helper
overruns become visible at all — but expect `ERangeError` in places the library
has always been sloppy about, and triage each one rather than treating it as a
build break.

## What is in here

| Unit | Covers |
|---|---|
| `CADSys4.Tests.Geometry` | `FNCCS4BaseTypes` value types and every canvas-free geometry function in `FNCCADSys4`: vector algebra, homogeneous coordinates, the 2D/3D transform algebra, box algebra, distance and clipping helpers. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Structures` | `TPointsSet2D`/`3D`, `TGraphicObjList` and its iterators, `TIndexedObjectList`, `TLayer`/`TLayers`, `TCADPrgParam` ownership. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Shapes` | Eight 2D shape families: construction, `Assign` round-trips and independence, bounding boxes, the `BeginUseProfilePoints` protocol, `OnMe` hit-testing, curve precision. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Persistence` | JSON: the `FNCCS4JSON` helpers, per-shape `SaveToJSON`/`CreateFromJSON`, whole-document round trips (layers, blocks, files, text) and the class registry. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.DXF` | DXF group-level round trips and one end-to-end import. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Legacy` | The old binary `.CS2` reader, against synthesised streams. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Views` | `TCADViewSpec`: defaults, the layer set, JSON and file round trips. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Graphics` | The drawing layer: VCL backend pixel tests, and shapes drawn through a recording backend (which proves no `TCanvas` is needed). |
| `CADSys4.Tests.GraphicsFNC` | The FNC backend. In `CADSysFNCTests`, not the main suite. |
| `CADSys4.Tests.Regressions` | One test per defect from `docs/port/optimization-review.md`. |

## Two things to know before you read the results

**Some tests pin defects rather than correct behaviour.** The suite documents
what the library *currently does*, including where that is wrong. Those tests are
named and commented to make it obvious.

**Some findings cannot be reached from a console runner.** Anything behind the
interaction FSM or a live viewport — the pan double-free, the draw-helper
overruns, the GDI font churn — needs a window. `CADSys4.Tests.Regressions`
records them as `[Ignore]`d tests whose ignore message says why and how to verify
them by hand. That is most of the 8 ignored. The same applies to findings
deliberately left unfixed: the placeholder is there so the gap stays visible.

**There is no fixture from before the port.** `FNCCS4Legacy` reads the old binary
format and is tested against streams the suite builds itself, but nothing in the
repository is a drawing the original library wrote, so nothing here proves a real
one loads.

## Running it against a memory-leak check

Most of the review's findings are lifetime bugs, so the suite is most useful with
FastMM4 in full-debug mode. Add `FastMM4` as the first unit in the `.dpr` uses
clause, drop `FastMM_FullDebugMode.dll` beside the exe, and set:

```pascal
ReportMemoryLeaksOnShutdown := True;
```

Every fixture frees what it creates through `try/finally`, so a clean shutdown
report is the expected result. A leak report naming a library class is a real
finding.

## Adding to it

Fixtures self-register in each unit's `initialization` via
`TDUnitX.RegisterTestFixture`, so a new fixture needs no change to the `.dpr` —
only a new unit added to the project's `DCCReference` list if it lives in a new
file.

The house rule that produced this suite is worth keeping: check the declaration
in `..\Sources` before you call anything, and where a numeric result depends on
flattening detail or accumulated floating point, assert the invariant (the box
contains the points; the count grew by one) rather than a constant you computed
by hand.
